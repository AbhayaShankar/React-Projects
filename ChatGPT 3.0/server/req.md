This is a Node.js server route that is listening for a POST request on the root URL.

When a POST request is received, it extracts the message property from the request body using destructuring assignment and assigns it to a variable.

The code then attempts to call a function openai.createCompletion() asynchronously to generate a textual response. The function takes several parameters including the machine learning model, prompt text, maximum number of tokens to generate, and a temperature value that controls randomness during generation.

If an error occurs during the function call, it is logged to the console and the server sends a HTTP response with status code 400. Otherwise, the generated text response can be further processed or sent back as a HTTP response to the client making the POST request.

Note that without additional context, it's not clear what openai is or where it comes from - it could be another module within the same file, or an external dependency installed in the project.

```javascript
app.post("/", async (req, res) => {
  const { message } = req.body;

  try {
    const response = await openai.createCompletion({
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301",
      prompt: `${message}`,
      max_tokens: 120,
      temperature: 0.5,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(err);
    res.send(err).status(400);
  }
});
```
